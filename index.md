# Machine Learning Projects

This section talks about the various assignments that have been done as part of the course.

> The business problem is ability to find right applicants and approve loan by reducing financial loss and increasing revenue.
> This project focusses on exploratory data analysis to find the key variables that will likely influence the charge-offs.

# BikeSharing Case Study

> Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

> This case study focusses on the variables which are significantly affecting the prediction of demand of bikes

> Used the following python modules

* numpy, pandas
* matplotlib, seaborn-0.13.2
* datetime
